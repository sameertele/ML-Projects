# **KNN Implementation and LeNet-5 Architecture Project**

This project contains two key files: 

1. **KNN Implementation from Scratch and Sklearn Comparison**
2. **LeNet-5 Neural Network Architecture for MNIST**

## **Project Overview**

### **1. KNN Implementation from Scratch**
- This file includes a custom implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm from scratch.
- The KNN algorithm is applied to **three different datasets**, and its performance is compared with the built-in **KNN implementation from Sklearn**.
- The goal is to evaluate which version of KNN performs better in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

### **2. LeNet-5 Architecture for MNIST**
- This file contains the implementation of the **LeNet-5 architecture**, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks.
- The network is built with various layers including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- The architecture is trained and evaluated on the **MNIST dataset**, achieving high accuracy on handwritten digit recognition.

## **Datasets Used**

- **KNN Implementation**: Three different datasets: Car Dataset, Hayes Roth Dataset and Breast Cancer Dataset
- **LeNet-5**: The **[MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)** containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## **How to Run**

1. Run the KNN implementation file to observe how KNN performs across different datasets and compare the custom implementation with Sklearn's KNN.
2. Run the LeNet-5 architecture file to train and evaluate the CNN on the MNIST dataset.
